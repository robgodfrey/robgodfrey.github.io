 <title>Wing Community Library - Progress Report – 24 November 2011</title>
 <link>http://www.wingvillage.org.uk/node/176</link>
 <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;http://www.wingvillage.org.uk/sites/default/files/wingvillagelibrary.jpg&quot; class=&quot;right&quot; width=&quot;320&quot; height=&quot;240&quot;/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Wing Community Library - Progress Report – 24 November 2011&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Library Steering Group, formed early this year, consists of a core of eight members, who have been meeting regularly. We have been joined at different times by our District councillor, Parish Councillors, representatives of the County Council, one of the local school librarians and other interested parties. We have distributed and analysed a questionnaire; and sub-committees have been focussing on finance, volunteers and the Business Plan. Recently one member has been shadowing the current librarians and writing a manual for volunteers; and the possibility of becoming a charity is being explored.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Steering Group is committed to running not just a Library Service, but an extended community resource for the benefit of the residents of Wing and surrounding villages, in partnership with the County Council. In particular we wish to retain this facility for those who cannot easily obtain Library services elsewhere and need a place close to home i.e. children and older people.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Our Business Plan has now been submitted to the County Council Library Strategy Project Board. Once approved there will be a transition period from January to August 2012, during which time volunteers will work alongside the present librarians and receive training from the County Council to allow the Library to commence as a Community Library, run solely by volunteers, from September 2012. During the transition period policies and procedures will be finalised for health &amp;amp; safety, volunteers, stock, marketing and finance.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Once the Community Library is fully established the Steering Group will become the Management Committee with an equal status for all, but members will take on specific responsibilities.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Our aims are:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;to create and follow a financially sustainable plan for the running of the Library;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;to maintain the service in the current premises;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;to encourage and increase membership and usage by Wing residents and those of neighbouring hamlets and villages;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;to increase the opening hours and expand the stock;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;to enhance the IT facilities in order to serve more people of all ages offering opportunities for lifelong learning;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;to establish the Library as an information hub;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;to provide additional activities - in particular those that will generate income and bring ‘added value’ to the community;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;to work in collaboration with the existing school libraries to encourage reading and bring enhanced opportunities to young people;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;to involve residents in running the Library and making decisions about its future direction in order to give a sense of ownership&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In conclusion, our mission is:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;‘To provide a welcoming environment for local people to enjoy books, have easy access to information, develop lifelong learning interests, and meet with each other.’&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

 <description>&lt;p&gt;Do you own a male Tabby Cat of approximately 4 to 5 years old that has gone missing?  He was found in Ledburn on the 15th July.  He is very friendly and affectionate and I would like him to be reunited with his owner.          &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you think this is your cat, could you please contact Nikki on 07984 256931&lt;/p&gt;

 <title>Library Questionnaire Results Summary</title>
 <link>http://www.wingvillage.org.uk/node/173</link>
 <description>&lt;p&gt;The Wing Library Group would like to thank everyone who took the trouble to complete and return the questionnaire. Although the response was disappointingly small there are some interesting findings.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;All credit to Lynn Stuart for encouraging some schoolchildren to fill in questionnaires. Although many of them do not live in the village, they give us some access to how young people think about the idea of a library and where there interests lie.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Of the non-school responses, it is interesting that almost half of those do not actually use Wing Library currently. This indicates (as also found in Chalfont St Giles) that many people support the idea of a local library and therefore may be willing to give some financial support as Friends.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;With regard to opening times – perhaps more of the young people would use the library if it was open at times that suit them better. Having access to the computers was particularly appealing to the younger people – though for some the main interest is to be able to play games. At least it would keep them off the streets!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Of the various other activities asked about, for the non-school respondents a second hand book shop, use of a photocopier, coffee &amp;amp; reading newspapers, and a village history project were the most popular – and some of these could actually generate some income.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There were many offers of help, and these will be followed up – perhaps in particular those people with the rarer finance, business and marketing skills.&lt;/p&gt;

 <title>Wing Library Developments</title>

&lt;p&gt;Wing Library is going to become a community partnership library. This is due to reductions in funding for library services across Buckinghamshire. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A group of interested villagers are looking at what this will mean for the village.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We would like to hear your views so that the ‘new’ library will develop in the way that people want.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Questionnaire&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Please &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.wingvillage.org.uk/sites/default/files/wing_library_questionnaire.docx&quot;&gt;download the questionnaire&lt;/a&gt; (docx - requires Word 2007 or higher) and spend a few minutes to let us know your thoughts. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Please send your replies by email to &lt;script type=&#039;text/javascript&#039;&gt;&lt;!--
    document.write(&#039;&lt;a href=&quot;&amp;#109;&amp;#97;&amp;#105;&amp;#108;&amp;#116;&amp;#111;&amp;#58;&#039;+&#039;&amp;#103;&amp;#105;&amp;#110;&amp;#110;&amp;#121;&amp;#104;&amp;#111;&amp;#108;&amp;#108;&amp;#97;&amp;#115;&amp;#64;&#039;+&#039;&amp;#104;&amp;#111;&amp;#116;&amp;#109;&amp;#97;&amp;#105;&amp;#108;&amp;#46;&#039;+&#039;&amp;#99;&amp;#111;&amp;#109;&#039;+&#039;&quot;&gt;&#039;+&#039;&amp;#103;&amp;#105;&amp;#110;&amp;#110;&amp;#121;&amp;#104;&amp;#111;&amp;#108;&amp;#108;&amp;#97;&amp;#115;&amp;#64;&#039;+&#039;&amp;#104;&amp;#111;&amp;#116;&amp;#109;&amp;#97;&amp;#105;&amp;#108;&amp;#46;&#039;+&#039;&amp;#99;&amp;#111;&amp;#109;&#039;+&#039;&lt;/a&gt;&#039;);
    //--&gt;
    &lt;/script&gt; or by hand/post to Wing Library by 31 June 11.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Further information about Wing Library and developments will be posted to the new &lt;a href=&quot;/thevillage/library&quot;&gt;&quot;Library&quot;&lt;/a&gt; page under &quot;The Village&quot; section of the website.&lt;/p&gt;
