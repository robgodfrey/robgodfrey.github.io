 <description>&lt;p&gt;The Stewkley under-11s football team is recruiting new players for next season.  We have had a successful year and are looking to build on this as we progress to 9-a-side next year.  Players need to be in Year 6 next year.  Experience of playing for a team is a plus.  For further information, please contact Frank Gesoff on 01525 240135 or 07970 034392.&lt;/p&gt;
