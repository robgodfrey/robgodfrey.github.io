 <title>Library Questionnaire Results Summary</title>
 <link>http://www.wingvillage.org.uk/node/173</link>
 <description>&lt;p&gt;The Wing Library Group would like to thank everyone who took the trouble to complete and return the questionnaire. Although the response was disappointingly small there are some interesting findings.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;All credit to Lynn Stuart for encouraging some schoolchildren to fill in questionnaires. Although many of them do not live in the village, they give us some access to how young people think about the idea of a library and where there interests lie.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Of the non-school responses, it is interesting that almost half of those do not actually use Wing Library currently. This indicates (as also found in Chalfont St Giles) that many people support the idea of a local library and therefore may be willing to give some financial support as Friends.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;With regard to opening times – perhaps more of the young people would use the library if it was open at times that suit them better. Having access to the computers was particularly appealing to the younger people – though for some the main interest is to be able to play games. At least it would keep them off the streets!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Of the various other activities asked about, for the non-school respondents a second hand book shop, use of a photocopier, coffee &amp;amp; reading newspapers, and a village history project were the most popular – and some of these could actually generate some income.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There were many offers of help, and these will be followed up – perhaps in particular those people with the rarer finance, business and marketing skills.&lt;/p&gt;
