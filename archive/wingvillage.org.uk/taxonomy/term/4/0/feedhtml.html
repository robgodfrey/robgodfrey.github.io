 <title>Safe and Secure Summer Home</title>
 <link>http://www.wingvillage.org.uk/node/147</link>
 <description>&lt;p&gt;Summer is finally here and whether you are planning a get away in the sun or&lt;br /&gt;
you’re simply out to do a spot of gardening, it is important to keep your home&lt;br /&gt;
safe and secure.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Whilst Aylesbury Vale has one of the lowest rates of burglary in the entire&lt;br /&gt;
Thames Valley area, the summer months typically lead to increased&lt;br /&gt;
opportunities. The majority of burglaries are opportunistic and take place&lt;br /&gt;
when a house is empty or when doors and windows are left insecure, even if&lt;br /&gt;
you’re at home and as close as the garden.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Aylesbury Vale District Council and Thames Valley Police are working&lt;br /&gt;
in partnership to keep burglary low over the summer months and asking&lt;br /&gt;
residents to follow the home security tips below:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Remember to close and lock your doors and windows, whether you are&lt;br /&gt;
just in the garden or in your home.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Ensure your home looks occupied even when you’re away – for example,&lt;br /&gt;
user timer switches with lights, cancel milk or mow the lawn before you go.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Mark belongings visibly and permanently with your house number and&lt;br /&gt;
postcode using a UV marker pen.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Remove all valuables from view. If you normally leave a valuable bicycle&lt;br /&gt;
in a shed, consider securing it in the house. Similarly, ensure tools in your&lt;br /&gt;
shed are out of sight and secure.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Get help from your neighbours – you could ask them to collect post, open&lt;br /&gt;
and close curtains or park in your driveway.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For further home safety advice please contact Thames Valley Police on&lt;br /&gt;
0845 8 505505 or visit &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.thamesvalley.police.uk/crprev/crprev-&quot; title=&quot;http://www.thamesvalley.police.uk/crprev/crprev-&quot;&gt;http://www.thamesvalley.police.uk/crprev/crprev-&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For a free UV property marking kit, please call into Customer Services&lt;br /&gt;
at Aylesbury Vale District Council, 66 High Street, Aylesbury or visit the&lt;br /&gt;
AVDC desk at the Buckingham Centre, Verney Close, Buckingham.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you are unable to travel due to a disability, please contact the Council on&lt;br /&gt;

 <title>Steer clear of car crime across Aylesbury Vale</title>
 <link>http://www.wingvillage.org.uk/node/134</link>
 <description>&lt;p&gt;If you’re thinking of taking advantage of the sunny weather with a walk in the Buckinghamshire countryside, don’t let thieves spoil it for you.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Although vehicle crime in the Vale is one of the lowest rates across the entire Thames Valley, AVDC and Thames Valley Police are asking residents to spare a thought for car security when visiting beauty spots in the coming months. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The misconception is that by parking in the middle of nowhere, possessions will be safer but the truth is that a quieter setting provides the perfect opportunity for a thief.  Don’t give thieves an easy opportunity. Follow the steps below to protect your car and valuables…. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;-    Securely look all doors and shut windows and sunroofs, even if you’re leaving your car for just a few minutes&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Don’t leave anything on display in your car, even a coat can be tempting&lt;br /&gt;
Take all valuables with you – do not leave them in the glove box, in the boot or under the seat, this is the first place a thief will look&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;For a car air freshener or a ‘no valuables have been left in this car’ sign&lt;/strong&gt; please call into Customer Services at Aylesbury Vale District Council, 66 High Street, Aylesbury or visit the AVDC desk at the Buckingham Centre, Verney Close, Buckingham. Information is also available at &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.aylesburyvaledc.gov.uk/communitysafety&quot; title=&quot;www.aylesburyvaledc.gov.uk/communitysafety&quot;&gt;www.aylesburyvaledc.gov.uk/communitysafety&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
If you are unable to travel due to a disability, please contact the Council on&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;01296 585615 and we can arrange to post the item. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;      Council and Police working together to reduce crime and disorder.   &lt;/p&gt;

 <title>New Year, New Presents – keep them safe</title>
 <link>http://www.wingvillage.org.uk/node/130</link>
 <description>&lt;p&gt;How better than to start the new year with a resolution to keep your property safe.&lt;br /&gt;
Aylesbury Vale District Council and Thames Valley Police are working in partnership to keep burglary low over the New Year period by encouraging residents to safeguard Christmas presents by using property marking kits.&lt;br /&gt;
The kits include a UV marker, which enables valuables to be marked with your house number and postcode so if goods do get stolen and then recovered by the police they can be returned to you.&lt;br /&gt;
Marking your property is quick and easy and is a fundamental deterrent to thieves as it exposes them to risk if caught  and prevents them from selling goods on.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For a free UV property marking kit, please call into Customer Services at Aylesbury Vale District Council, 66 High Street, Aylesbury or visit the AVDC desk at the Buckingham Centre, Verney Close, Buckingham.   &lt;/p&gt;

 <title>Rubbish Collection Cancelled</title>
 <link>http://www.wingvillage.org.uk/node/97</link>
 <description>&lt;p&gt;Today&#039;s rounds have been cancelled. The council apologises for any inconvenience this causes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;AVDC has cancelled today&#039;s refuse and recycling collection following the heavy snow fall overnight. Apart from the road conditions, particularly the side roads which are not yet gritted, the depth of snow on the pavements would make it difficult to pull the bins. Rain is forecast for the area, but is not expected to be in time to allow the rounds to go ahead. Residents are asked to take their bins and baskets back in until the collection next week. The  recylcing banks across the Vale are available as usual.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;More information can be found on our website &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.aylesburyvaledc.gov.uk&quot; title=&quot;www.aylesburyvaledc.gov.uk&quot;&gt;www.aylesburyvaledc.gov.uk&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
