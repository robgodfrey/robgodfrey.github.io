 <title>£50,000 WREN Grant Secured for Jubilee Green Play Area</title>
 <link>http://www.wingvillage.org.uk/node/132</link>
 <description>&lt;p&gt;I&#039;m very pleased to announce that the Jubilee Green Management Committee has managed to successfully secure a WREN grant of £50,000 towards replacing the play area on Jubilee Green. This is a great achievement and is the result of 18 months hard work by the Jubilee Green Management Committee, all done on a voluntary basis. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Having secured funding, this now means we are in a position to proceed with the plans for the play area, which we anticipate being completed this year. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Further details of the proposed plan for the play area can be found &lt;a href=&quot;/parishcouncil/jgmc&quot;&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Rob Godfrey, Chair JGMC&lt;/p&gt;

 <title>Play Area Gets a New Lease of Life</title>
 <link>http://www.wingvillage.org.uk/node/119</link>
 <description>&lt;p&gt;I&#039;m pleased that we have recently been able to carry out some maintenance on Jubilee Green. Thanks to all those who volunteered their time and effort. The swings, seesaw and roundabouts have all had a lick of paint. There&#039;s still a coat or two to go on but the difference already is amazing. Also the bark pits under the climbing frame and little roundabout have been cleared of weeds, had new timber edging installed and refilled with recycled woodchip made from wooden pallets which is environmentally friendly. Over 60 hours of labour have been volunteered so far. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Thank you to: Gemma, Richard an Jacob Godivala and their small army of 25 volunteers, John Nixon, Claire Collier, Simon, Charlotte and Daniel Hellgren-Derry, Gwyn Jones-Williams, Jenni Marr, Ben May, Tracy Gregory, Nikki Wright, Mary Stephens, the 4 lads who happened to be in the park and got stuck in, plus the few others. Sorry I don&#039;t recall all your names, you know who you are. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There will be a few more working parties in the coming weeks, which we&#039;ll work in around the weather. If you would like to help out please let me know on 681129.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Rob Godfrey, Chair JGMC &lt;/p&gt;

 <title>Jubilee Green Consultation</title>
 <link>http://www.wingvillage.org.uk/node/111</link>
 <description>&lt;p&gt;The Jubilee Green Management Committee is currently undertaking a village wide consultation about Jubilee Green. Questionnaires are being delivered to every household in Wing between the 12th April and the 19th April, and will then subsequently be collected between the 19th April and the 3rd May 2009.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The main purpose of the consultation is to establish a body of evidence to support grant applications to funding bodies such as WREN, AVDC Community Chest, and the National Lottery funds. This grant money will be used to restore Jubilee Green and the childrens play area.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Based on a number of quotes, to renew the childrens play area with new swings, roundabouts, seesaw, slide and fencing will cost in excess of £50,000. There is currently some money set aside from historic property developments, but the majority of this money will need to raised from grant bodies / other means.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Please help us improve the facilities on Jubilee Green for the benefit of everyone. The questionnaire will only take about 5 minutes to complete.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Many Thanks&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Jubilee Green Management Committee&lt;/p&gt;
