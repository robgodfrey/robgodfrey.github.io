      <a href="node/157.html">The view from the Vicarage - Feb 2011</a>
    </h2>
  
  
  
  <div class="content">
    <p>Two men, deep in conversation, walked down a bustling city street. One is at home, the other visiting from the countryside.</p>
<p>Passing a tree, the visitor suddenly stopped.  ‘Can you hear that?’ he asked as pedestrians squeezed and bumped past them.</p>
<p>‘Hear what?’ his friend replied.</p>
<p>‘The cricket singing.  It must be in the tree.’  He leant with one ear towards the tree to tune into the source of the song.</p>
<p>‘There’s no cricket, it’s in your head!’ the city worker exclaimed, as a woman walked by shouting into her phone.  ‘And, even if there were, you’d never hear it over the noise of all these people and this traffic.’</p>
<p>The visitor’s friend laughed and walked on.</p>
<p>But, as he did so, the visitor pulled a small coin from his pocket and let it drop to the ground.  The coin hit the pavement and quietly rolled to rest.</p>
<p>Intuitively his friend twisted his head round, glancing over his shoulder at the ground to search for the coin.  At the same moment, perhaps twenty other pedestrians surreptitiously scanned the ground as they walked by.</p>
<p>With a smile, the visitor looked at his friend and said, ‘You’re listening to the wrong tune.’</p>
<p>When we become attuned to the music of creation, we notice God’s harmonies everywhere.  We hear them in the echoes of the mountain range and the heaving of the sea, sitting round a meal table with friends, in the shining eyes of an old man who allows a memory to touch the surface of his mind, in the quiet contentment of a babbling baby.</p>
<p>Those who do not listen will not hear.  Those who do not search will see nothing but the obvious:  ‘in spite of his wonders, they did not believe’  Psalm 78:32</p>

      <a href="node/156.html">The View from the Vicarage - December 2010 </a>
    </h2>
  
  
  
  <div class="content">
    <p>Years ago a wealthy widower, shared a passion for art collecting with his only child, Mark. Together  they  travelled  around  the  world, adding priceless works to their collection by the likes of Picasso, Van Gogh and Monet.</p>
<p>As winter approached, war engulfed their nation, and Mark left to serve his country.  After only a few short weeks, his father received a telegram; his beloved son had died saving the life of a fellow soldier.  Distraught, the old man faced the approaching Christmas with anguish and sadness.<br />
On Christmas morning a knock on the door woke him.  At the door was a soldier with a large package.  “I was a friend of Mark,” the soldier said.  “I was the one he rescued.  May I come in, I have something to show you?”</p>
<p>The old man learned that Mark had rescued dozens of soldiers before a bullet took his caring heart.  The soldier then recounted how Mark had spoken of his father’s love of fine art.  Giving the package to the old man, the soldier told him, “I’m an artist.  I want you to have this.”</p>
<p>The old man unwrapped the package revealing a portrait of his son.  The canvas featured the young man’s face in striking detail, though the world would never consider the painting the work of a genius.  Overcome with emotion, the man thanked the soldier as he left.</p>
<p>The old man set about hanging the portrait above the fireplace, pushing aside paintings by masters that had cost thousands of dollars.  Seating himself in his chair, he spent Christmas gazing at the gift he had been given.  In the weeks that followed, the man grew peaceful realizing that Mark lived on because of those he had touched. </p>
<p>The following Spring, the old man became ill and died.  The art world stirred in anticipation of the public auction of the old man's estate.  He had stipulated that his collection be sold on Christmas Day—the day he had received his greatest gift.  On the appointed day art collectors from around the world gathered to bid.<br />
The auction began with a painting not on any museum’s must-have list—the soldier's painting of the old man’s son.  “May I have an opening bid?”  The room was silent.  “Who will open the bidding with $100?”  the Auctioneer prompted.  Minutes passed and still no one spoke.  “Who cares about that painting?” shouted a bidder from the back of the room, “It’s just a picture of his son.  Forget it, go on to the good stuff.”</p>
<p>“No, we have to sell this one first,” replied the auctioneer. “Now, who will take the son?” Finally, a friend of the old man spoke.  “I'd like to have the painting.  I knew the boy.  Will you take ten dollars for it?  That’s all I have.”</p>
<p>“I have ten dollars," called the auctioneer.  “Will anyone go higher?”  More silence.  “Going once... Going twice," he said looking around for any takers.  “Gone,” he said at last.</p>
<p>“Now  we  can  get  on  with  bidding  on  these treasures!” said the man from the back.<br />
Over the microphone the auctioneer said.  “Thank you for coming. The auction is now over.”<br />
Stunned disbelief quieted the room.  “What do you mean it’s over?” growled an irate bidder, “What about  all  of  these  other  paintings?   There  are millions of dollars of art here!”</p>
<p>“It’s very simple," replied the auctioneer.  “According to the will of the father, whoever takes the son... gets it all.<br />
(Adapted from 2001 Youth Specialities Inc)</p>
<p>That is the will of the Father today. Whoever takes the Son... gets it all.  When you take Jesus the Christ, the babe born in a manger in Bethlehem over 2000 years ago, as your Saviour, you will have the riches of life to its fullest (John 10:10, Matthew 6:33) – the only Christmas present worth having!       </p>
<p>Debbie and I wish you all a very peaceful and blessed Christmas</p>
<p>Shalom<br />

    </h2>
  
  
  
  <div class="content">
    <p>Wing Parish Council are very pleased to announce that work has now completed on the new play area on Jubilee Green. </p>
<p>Please note the following:</p>
<ul>
<li>The play area is very muddy at the moment. Please wear suitable footwear and clothing.</li>
<li>The upright tree sections in the toddler area will be carved by a chainsaw carver at the end of November</li>
<li>The mounding and log walk need some time for grass to seed and therefore the temporary fencing will remain until spring next year</li>
</ul>
<p><a href="sites/default/files/jg/JG-Graphic.jpg" target="_blank"><img src="sites/default/files/jg/JG-Graphic-thumb.jpg"/></a></p>
<p>Getting to this stage is the result of 2 years of effort by the Jubilee Green Management Committee and Wing Parish Council. Earlier this year the committee were successful in obtaining a grant from WREN for £50,000 towards the cost of the project. Other funding has been provided by AVDC and a Section 106 development grant, with the remainder being made up the parish council. The project has cost close to £75,000 (inc VAT). </p>
<p>The new play area has been designed in accordance with guidance from Play England and in consultation with the AVDC green spaces team, and includes new equipment as well as natural mounds and ditches, and incorporating the tree trunk sections felled earlier this year. A ROSPA post installation safety inspection has been carried out, with no major issues highlighted. Some minor issues with the matting surfacing have been resolved, and the installers will be out to resolve some issues with the log walk (currently fenced off) in due course.   </p>
<p>An official opening event will take place early in the new year. </p>

    <p>Solar power for the Saxon Church</p>
<p>Our Anglo Saxon church, recognised as being one of the finest in England, is being fitted with state-of-<br />
the art solar panels.</p>
<p>The Church of England has a Shrinking the Footprint national environmental campaign and a recent<br />
BBC’s Songs of Praise programme came from St Denys Church, Sleaford, Lincolnshire and showed what<br />
was possible with the technology. All churches face east and therefore have the south facing roofs ideal<br />
for solar installations - but could modern equipment be installed on such an ancient monument as ours<br />
with its four star rating in Simon Jenkins book England’s Thousand Best Churches?</p>
<p>The members of All Saints’ decided that they could not just talk about, and pray for, the environment;<br />
there was a need to get out there and do something to look after God’s creation by reducing their<br />
carbon footprint. After a huge effort to prove feasibility and get all the necessary permissions, grants<br />
and donations for the work, installation of 54 photovoltaic panels starts in November. Wing Church is<br />
the first to be so equipped in the whole of the Oxford Diocese and hopefully will set a standard for others<br />
to follow.</p>
<p>Not only will we be doing good for the environment, but also we will gain free electricity and added<br />
income from the government’s new Feed-In tariffs. These were introduced in April 2010 for the energy<br />
we put into the National Grid. This is an exciting project and hopefully the first in a series to make Wing<br />
Church carbon neutral.</p>

    </h2>
  
  
  
  <div class="content">
    <p>Wing Parish Council are very pleased to announce that work has now begun to replace the play area on Jubilee Green. Contractors from Wicksteed Playscapes will be working on site for the next 4 to 5 weeks, and are due to complete in mid November.   </p>
<p><a href="sites/default/files/jg/JG-Graphic.jpg" target="_blank"><img src="sites/default/files/jg/JG-Graphic-thumb.jpg"/></a></p>
<p>The new play area designs can be seen <a href="playarea.html">here</a>. </p>
<p>Getting to this stage is the result of 2 years of effort by the Jubilee Green Management Committee and Wing Parish Council. Earlier this year the committee were successful in obtaining a grant from WREN for £50,000 towards the cost of the project. Other funding has been provided by AVDC and a Section 106 development grant, with the remainder being made up the parish council. The project will cost close to £75,000 (inc VAT). </p>
<p>The new play area has been designed in accordance with guidance from Play England and in consultation with the AVDC green spaces team, and will include new equipment as well as natural mounds and ditches, and incorporating the felled tree trunk sections currently lying on Jubilee Green.  </p>
<p>An official opening event is likely to take place in the new year.</p>
<p>Please direct any queries / questions to <a href="parishcouncil.html">Wing Parish Council</a>.</p>
