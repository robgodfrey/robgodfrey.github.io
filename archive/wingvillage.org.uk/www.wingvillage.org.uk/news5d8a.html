    </h2>
  
  
  
  <div class="content">
    <p>I recently received this curious e-mail:<br />
     “I decide to water my garden.  As I turn on the hose in the driveway, I look over at my car and decide it needs washing. As I start towards the garage, I notice today's post on the porch table that I left there earlier. I decide to go through the post before I wash the car. I lay my car keys on the table, put the junk mail in the rubbish bin under the table, and notice that it is full.  So, I decide to put the bills back on the table and take out the rubbish first, but then I think, since I'm going to be near the letterbox when I take out the rubbish anyway, I may as well pay the bills first. I take my cheque book off the table, and see that there is only one cheque left. My extra cheques are in my desk in the study, so I go inside the house to my desk where I find the tin of beer I'd been drinking. I'm going to look for my cheques, but first I need to push the beer aside so that I don't accidentally knock it over. The beer is getting warm, and I decide to put it in the fridge to keep it cold. As I head toward the kitchen with the beer, a vase of flowers on the counter catches my eye - they need water. I put the beer on the counter and discover my reading glasses that I've been searching for all morning. I decide I better put them back on my desk, but first I'm going to water the flowers. I set the glasses back down on the counter, fill a container with water and suddenly spot the TV remote. Someone left it on the kitchen table. I realize that tonight when we go to watch TV, I'll be looking for the remote, but I won't remember that it's on the kitchen table, so I decide to put it back in the lounge where it belongs, but first I'll water the flowers. I pour some water in the flowers, but quite a bit of it spills on the floor. So, I set the remote back on the table, get some towels and wipe up the spill. Then, I head down the hall trying to remember what I was planning to do.<br />
At the end of the day:<br />
     the car isn't washed<br />
     the bills aren't paid<br />
     there is a warm tin of beer sitting on the counter<br />
     the flowers don't have enough water<br />
     there is still only 1 cheque in my cheque book<br />
     I can't find the remote<br />
     I can't find my glasses<br />
     and I don't remember what I did with the car keys</p>
<p>Then, when I try to work out why nothing got done today, I'm really baffled because I know I was busy all day, and I'm really tired. I realise this is a serious problem, and I'll try to get some help for it, but first I'll check my e-mail...</p>
<p>Do me a favour. Forward this message to everyone you know, because I don't remember who the heck I've sent it to.”</p>
<p>Don't laugh -- if this isn't you yet, your day is coming!!</p>
<p>We lead such busy lives. We charge around like bluebottles trying to get things done. It was just the same in Jesus’ day but he had the solution. He followed his Father’s plan and always made sure he had a day off each week, always made sure he took ‘time-out’ during the day, and made sure his pace of life was slower. Companies that follow Christian principles and ensure staff never have to stay late and take a good lunch-break find that more work gets done more efficiently by a happier workforce. We shouldn’t be surprised – it’s simply following the way of the one who created us. </p>
<p>Following God’s way in all things makes for a life where we can be fully human.<br />
Shalom</p>

    <p>I'm pleased that we have recently been able to carry out some maintenance on Jubilee Green. Thanks to all those who volunteered their time and effort. The swings, seesaw and roundabouts have all had a lick of paint. There's still a coat or two to go on but the difference already is amazing. Also the bark pits under the climbing frame and little roundabout have been cleared of weeds, had new timber edging installed and refilled with recycled woodchip made from wooden pallets which is environmentally friendly. Over 60 hours of labour have been volunteered so far. </p>
<p>Thank you to: Gemma, Richard an Jacob Godivala and their small army of 25 volunteers, John Nixon, Claire Collier, Simon, Charlotte and Daniel Hellgren-Derry, Gwyn Jones-Williams, Jenni Marr, Ben May, Tracy Gregory, Nikki Wright, Mary Stephens, the 4 lads who happened to be in the park and got stuck in, plus the few others. Sorry I don't recall all your names, you know who you are. </p>
<p>There will be a few more working parties in the coming weeks, which we'll work in around the weather. If you would like to help out please let me know on 681129.</p>

    <p><strong>The L o n g Silence<br />
      – a short story for the holidays</strong><br />
	At the end of time, billions of people were scattered on a vast plain before God’s throne.  Some groups talked heatedly.  ‘How can God judge us?’  ‘What does he know about suffering?’ snapped a young woman.  She jerked back a sleeve to reveal a tattooed number from a Nazi concentration camp.  A black man lowered his collar.  ‘What about this?’ he demanded, showing an ugly rope burn.  ‘Lynched for no crime but being black.  We have suffocated in slave ships, been wrenched from loved ones and toiled till only death gave release.’</p>
<p>	Many other people recounted stories of suffering.  Each had a complaint against God for the evil and suffering he permitted in his world.  How lucky he was to live in heaven where all was sweetness and light; where there was no weeping, no fear, no hunger and no hatred.  All agreed that God seemed to lead a pretty sheltered life.</p>
<p>	So each group sent out a representative.  There was a Jew, a black woman, an untouchable from India, an illegitimate child, a victim from Hiroshima, a sweatshop worker, a prisoner from a labour camp.  In the centre of the plain they consulted.</p>
<p>	At last they were ready to present their case.  It was very daring.  Before God could  qualify  to  be  their  judge,  he  must endure  what  they  had  endured.   So  the decision was made:  God should be sentenced to live on earth – as a man!  But, because he was God, they set certain safeguards to be sure he could not use his divine powers to help himself:-</p>
<p>Let him be born a Jew.<br />
Let the legitimacy of his birth be 	doubted, so that no one will know who his father really is.<br />
Let him champion a cause so just, but 	so radical, that it brings down upon him the hatred and condemnation of the establishment.<br />
Let him try to describe what no man has ever seen, tasted, heard or smelled 	… Let him try to communicate God to men.<br />
Let him be betrayed by his dearest friends.<br />
Let him be indicted on false charges, tried before a prejudiced jury, and 	convicted by a cowardly judge.<br />
Let him be terribly alone and abandoned.<br />
Let him be tortured.<br />
Then let him die a humiliating death alongside common criminals.</p>
<p>	As each leader announced a portion of the sentence, there were shouts of approval from   the   people.    But   after   the   final statement, there was a long silence.  No one uttered another word.  No one moved.</p>
<p>	For suddenly all knew … God, in Jesus, had already served his sentence.<br />

    <p>	I rather suspect, although I write these pieces nearly a month in advance,  that  people  will  still  be angry with our politicians.  I expect that the parties will be vying with one another to assure us that their party ‘has the answer’ about how to fix things. </p>
<p>	Their problem is that “people today are suspicious of anything that claims to be the answer, the truth, the system, the solution – and understandably so.  So often the people who have made such claims have ended up advancing them by force.  The Church had its Inquisition.   Fascism  had  its Auschwitz.   Communism  had  its Gulag Archipelago.  Islam has its Taliban.  They have made us wary of     totalitarian     systems     of government.”<br />
(Michael Lloyd ‘Café Theology’)</p>
<p>Jesus said:<br />
‘I am the way, the truth and the life.  No one can come to the Father except through me.’        John 14:6</p>
<p>	Quite a claim, but Jesus didn’t impose His agenda upon others.  God gives us freedom and insists we should respect that freedom in others.  So despite claiming to be the  way,  truth  and  life  he  never imposes that way on us.  Rather he allowed others to impose their agenda on him.  This apparently weak, stumbling, wounded God, made us and respects us, gives us freedom and respects that freedom, allows us to rebel against him, to reject him and to kill him.  Such a God is Love, and knows the nature of love, that it cannot be forced.  He insists that we give others the same freedom he has given to us all.</p>
<p>	Only this way of looking at the world, based on such a God, can thus defuse the justifiable fears we have of being told ‘the answer’.</p>
<p>	The truth is that the truth, the answer, the way, the life is only  safe  in  nail-scarred  hands, Jesus’ hands.  God does not impose it upon us but gently invites us to try it out for ourselves.</p>
<p>	Why not try it for yourself? – Because, as they say on the ads, you’re worth it.</p>

    <p>Does it seem to you that someone has made a mess of things? </p>
<p>Life seems to be getting more difficult for many despite our efforts to hold things together. Politicians don’t seem to know what to do to fix things (or how to set us a good example), job prospects are uncertain to say the least whether a lorry driver or an architect, our wealth and pensions are shrinking, and it all puts such stress into our family lives.</p>
<p>How did we get to this?</p>
<p>“What happened was this: People knew God perfectly well, but when they didn’t treat him like God, refusing to worship him, they trivialised themselves into silliness and confusion so that there was neither sense nor direction left in their lives. They pretended to know it all, but were illiterate regarding life. They traded the glory of God who holds the whole world in his hands for cheap figurines you can buy at any roadside stand.</p>
<p>“If you go against the grain, you get splinters, regardless of which neighbourhood you’re from, what your parents taught you, what schools you attended. But if you embrace the way God does things, there are wonderful payoffs, again without regard to where you are from or how you are brought up…  God  pays  no  attention  to  what others say (or what you think) about you. He makes up his own mind.”</p>
<p>We’ve been going against the grain and suffering the consequences. God created a wonderful playground for us, but we can only enjoy it if we follow the guidance he sets out – love God and love each other. In other words we need to ‘downsize self’ and ‘invest’ in looking out for and serving both others and God. That’s THE solution for ‘living with the grain’ in this world. It is the way we are attempting to follow in our church community. It is the way modelled by Jesus who said: ‘I am the way, the truth and the life.’ It is the way that offers a fresh start, a new life to everyone – life in its fullness.</p>
<p>If you want to talk about living life with less splinters give me a call.</p>
<p>Shalom</p>

  <div class="content">
    <p>A surgeon was awakened by a phone call at 2:30 one frigid winter morning. The nurse on the line explained that an eight-year-old boy had been hit by a car and was bleeding profusely. The attending physician had determined that unless the boy was operated on immediately, he would not survive.</p>
<p>The surgeon threw on his clothes and rushed out into the subzero weather. He scraped his car’s windshield just enough to be able to see where he was going and started the icy five-mile trip to the hospital. Each time he stopped at a red light he opened his car door and leaned out just enough to scrape a little more ice from the windshield.</p>
<p>At one intersection, about a mile and a half from the hospital, the surgeon noticed a man wearing  a  brown  coat  and  an  old  green  hat impatiently trying to cross the street. As the surgeon leaned out of his car, the man rushed over, grabbed him by his coat, and pulled him to the ground.</p>
<p>The surgeon tried to put up a fight but was no match for the burly, and apparently desperate, man. While the surgeon struggled to his feet, the man jumped in the surgeon’s car and drove away.</p>
<p>Unhurt, the surgeon hurried to a phone booth and called for a cab. Twenty minutes later he finally made it to the hospital. 	“Where’s the boy who was hit by a car?” he asked one of the nurses as he hurried through the emergency room. The nurse’s eyes welled up with tears. “We couldn’t stop the bleeding,” she said. “He died just a few minutes ago. His parents are still in the waiting area, if you’d like to speak to them.”</p>
<p>The surgeon took a deep breath and walked out into the waiting area. A woman in a long red coat was sitting in the middle of the room, sobbing silently into her hands. Behind her, a man stood with his hand on her shoulder. His head was bowed and his eyes were closed.</p>
<p>He was wearing a brown coat and an old green hat. (from Hot Illustrations)</p>
<p>The boy’s father, in his rush to get to the hospital, had pushed aside the one man who could have saved his son’s life. Many of us rush through life pushing aside ‘the Great Physician’, Jesus —the only one who is capable of giving us life.  He  alone  can  bring  healing  and  hope  to broken lives, broken families, and broken relationships. </p>
<p>Find out more about Jesus by joining us on a ‘Journey’ together.  We’ll explore through the stories and journeys of others whether there is a spiritual side to us; if God and heaven exist, what they are like; whether the faith thing works in real life; whether God has real power to change things; and what it’s like to join in with his ‘journey’.</p>
<p>‘Journeys’ will run for 5 weeks beginning on Friday May 8th at 7.30pm at Wing Chapel, Littleworth Road, Wing, each evening beginning with a simple meal. For more details please contact me on the number below or Pippa pearce on 01525 633378 (it’s ok to just turn up on any of the nights, but it’s helpful if we have some idea of how many might be coming!) </p>
<p>Shalom</p>

    </h2>
  
  
  
  <div class="content">
    <p>The Jubilee Green Management Committee is currently undertaking a village wide consultation about Jubilee Green. Questionnaires are being delivered to every household in Wing between the 12th April and the 19th April, and will then subsequently be collected between the 19th April and the 3rd May 2009.</p>
<p>The main purpose of the consultation is to establish a body of evidence to support grant applications to funding bodies such as WREN, AVDC Community Chest, and the National Lottery funds. This grant money will be used to restore Jubilee Green and the childrens play area.</p>
<p>Based on a number of quotes, to renew the childrens play area with new swings, roundabouts, seesaw, slide and fencing will cost in excess of £50,000. There is currently some money set aside from historic property developments, but the majority of this money will need to raised from grant bodies / other means.</p>
<p>Please help us improve the facilities on Jubilee Green for the benefit of everyone. The questionnaire will only take about 5 minutes to complete.</p>
<p>Many Thanks</p>

    <p>It was obvious that eight-year-old Stephen’s mental retardation was becoming even more severe. His Sunday school teacher did her best to include Stephen in the classroom activities and to avoid situations which might prompt his classmates to make fun of him.</p>
<p>In April, she gave each of the eight children in the class an empty L’eggs pantyhose container (plastic egg) and instructed them to place inside the container an object that represented new life in spring. Fearing that Stephen might not have caught on, and not wanting to embarrass him, the teacher had the children place all the containers on the desk so that she could open them.</p>
<p>The first had a tiny flower in it. “What a lovely sign of new life,” said the teacher. One of the students couldn’t help but erupt, “I brought that one!”</p>
<p>Next came a rock. The teacher assumed this must be Stephen’s, since rocks don’t symbolize new life. But Billy shouted that his rock had moss on it, and moss represented new life. “Very good, Billy,” agreed the teacher.</p>
<p>A butterfly flew from the third container and another child bragged that her choice was the best of all.</p>
<p>The fourth container was empty. This must be Stephen’s, thought the teacher, quickly reaching for a different one.</p>
<p>“Teacher, please don’t skip mine,” interrupted Stephen.</p>
<p>“But it’s empty, Stephen.” said the teacher gently.</p>
<p>“That’s right,” said Stephen. “The tomb was empty, and that represents new life for everyone.”</p>
<p>Later that summer, Stephen’s condition  worsened  and  he  died.  At  his funeral on his casket, mourners found eight L’eggs pantyhose containers—one from each of his classmates—and all of them empty.</p>
<p>…and that’s why all the best </p>
<p>Easter eggs are empty. </p>
<p>Jesus defeated death and rose from the dead  - not a fantasy, many people met him after he rose again. Because God did it for him he can offer the rock-solid promise that all who believe in him and follow his way will follow him through the door of death to a fantastic new life. </p>
<p>But there’s an even better promise than that!</p>
<p>Jesus promised that that new life can start right now in this one. Do you yearn for a life full of meaning and purpose, a life lived to the full? That’s the gift that he offers you this Easter. </p>
<p>Why not receive it?<br />

    <p>Do you hate to lose?  Do  you  think  it  is  right  to  make  sure  your children always win so as not to damage their self esteem?</p>
<p>As a young boy I loved to play cards with my Nan (usually 2 pack Rummy). She was always fun and I loved her to bits, but she would always beat me. I did not like this quality in her at the time but I understand better now. My Nan was trying to teach me about one of the great challenges of life. </p>
<p>Our society has an expectation that we can all be winners, or at least be  treated  equally. If  we  loose  we  cry  unfair,  find  excuses  why  it’s somebody else’s fault and start to get resentful. But as all but one of the contestants find out on the TV talent shows, life isn’t like that. </p>
<p>When in your education or training did you ever take a course on how to lose well? Yet losing is an inevitable part of life. To live is to lose. But to lose badly, gracelessly, can be lethal. Losing well is an art that requires all the grace we can muster. It means having the humility to face reality full in the face with no excuses, no blaming, no self-pity, no self-condemnation. It needs acquiring the discernment to know when to quit. </p>
<p>In the long run true esteem comes only from knowing we can handle reality,  which  means  both  wins  and  losses.  My  Nan  knew  it  was  very important for a child to lose sometimes. It means learning to say ‘congratulations’.</p>
<p>When Jesus hung on the cross he showed us what grace looks like at the moment of ultimate loss: a rejected Messiah carrying your loss and mine with inextinguishable grace. Hanging there he said: ‘Father, forgive them, for they know not what they are doing.’ He teaches us to seek the welfare of others rather than ourselves. At the cross we learn to lose with grace.<br />
