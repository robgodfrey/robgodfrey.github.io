    </h2>
  
  
  
  <div class="content">
    <p>If you’re thinking of taking advantage of the sunny weather with a walk in the Buckinghamshire countryside, don’t let thieves spoil it for you.  </p>
<p>Although vehicle crime in the Vale is one of the lowest rates across the entire Thames Valley, AVDC and Thames Valley Police are asking residents to spare a thought for car security when visiting beauty spots in the coming months. </p>
<p>The misconception is that by parking in the middle of nowhere, possessions will be safer but the truth is that a quieter setting provides the perfect opportunity for a thief.  Don’t give thieves an easy opportunity. Follow the steps below to protect your car and valuables…. </p>
<p>-    Securely look all doors and shut windows and sunroofs, even if you’re leaving your car for just a few minutes</p>
<p>Don’t leave anything on display in your car, even a coat can be tempting<br />
Take all valuables with you – do not leave them in the glove box, in the boot or under the seat, this is the first place a thief will look</p>
<p><strong>For a car air freshener or a ‘no valuables have been left in this car’ sign</strong> please call into Customer Services at Aylesbury Vale District Council, 66 High Street, Aylesbury or visit the AVDC desk at the Buckingham Centre, Verney Close, Buckingham. Information is also available at <a href="http://www.aylesburyvaledc.gov.uk/communitysafety" title="www.aylesburyvaledc.gov.uk/communitysafety">www.aylesburyvaledc.gov.uk/communitysafety</a><br />
If you are unable to travel due to a disability, please contact the Council on</p>
<p>01296 585615 and we can arrange to post the item. </p>

    </h2>
  
  
  
  <div class="content">
    <p>A touch of Easter shopping?</p>
<p>As I was walking down life's highway<br />
many years ago<br />
I came upon a sign that read<br />
Heavens Grocery Store.</p>
<p>When I got a little closer<br />
The doors swung open wide<br />
And when I came to myself<br />
I was standing inside.</p>
<p>I saw a host of Angels.<br />
They were standing everywhere<br />
One handed me a basket<br />
And said 'My child shop with care.'</p>
<p>Everything a human needed<br />
Was in that grocery store<br />
And what you could not carry<br />
You could come back for more</p>
<p>First I got some patience.<br />
Love was in that same row.<br />
Further down was understanding,<br />
You need that everywhere you go.</p>
<p>I got a box or two of Wisdom<br />
And Faith a bag or two.<br />
And Charity of course<br />
I would need some of that too.</p>
<p>I couldn't miss the Holy Ghost<br />
It was all over the place.<br />
And then some strength and Courage<br />
to help me run this race.<br />
My basket was getting full<br />
But I remembered I needed Grace.</p>
<p>And then I chose Salvation for<br />
Salvation was for free<br />
I tried to get enough of that<br />
to do for you and me.</p>
<p>Then I started to the counter<br />
To pay my grocery bill.<br />
For I thought I had everything<br />
To do the Masters will.<br />
As I went up the aisle I saw<br />
Prayer and put that in,<br />
For I knew when I stepped outside<br />
I would run into Sin.</p>
<p>Peace and Joy were plentiful,<br />
The last things on the shelf.<br />
Song and Praise were hanging near<br />
So I just helped myself. </p>
<p>Then I said to the angel<br />
'Now how much do I owe?'<br />
He smiled and said:<br />
'Just take them everywhere you go.'</p>
<p>Again I asked: 'Really now,<br />
How much do I owe?'<br />
'My child' he said, 'God paid your bill<br />
A long long time ago.'</p>
<p>At Easter we remember that Jesus died on a cross to pay our ‘bill’ for going our own way and not God’s. He did this so that if and when we turn back to God, there is no barrier of an unpaid debt and we are accepted just as we are, warts and all!<br />
But the good news doesn’t stop there!<br />
God raised Jesus from the dead and made sure there were many witnesses. But that’s still not the really good news.<br />
The really good news is that God promises that anyone who follows the way of Jesus will follow Jesus through the door of death to a fresh new life just like he did - a life where we can play for eternity in the playground of a renewed earth and a universe suddenly full of life.<br />
I can’t wait – and the good news is I don’t have to. If I follow the way of Jesus now I can enjoy a taste of heaven on earth, I can be to others a taste of heaven on earth, because Jesus will be walking with me!<br />
Shalom</p>

    </h2>
  
  
  
  <div class="content">
    <p>How better than to start the new year with a resolution to keep your property safe.<br />
Aylesbury Vale District Council and Thames Valley Police are working in partnership to keep burglary low over the New Year period by encouraging residents to safeguard Christmas presents by using property marking kits.<br />
The kits include a UV marker, which enables valuables to be marked with your house number and postcode so if goods do get stolen and then recovered by the police they can be returned to you.<br />
Marking your property is quick and easy and is a fundamental deterrent to thieves as it exposes them to risk if caught  and prevents them from selling goods on.  </p>
<p>For a free UV property marking kit, please call into Customer Services at Aylesbury Vale District Council, 66 High Street, Aylesbury or visit the AVDC desk at the Buckingham Centre, Verney Close, Buckingham.   </p>

    </h2>
  
  
  
  <div class="content">
    <p>About a year ago, you may remember Magdeline Makola, a nurse in Scotland,  was locked in the boot of her own car  for  10  days without   food   or water and deprived of her basic needs.  Her captor had threatened to kill her if she didn’t give him the PIN number to her bank account.  Magdeline miraculously survived this harrowing ordeal and was rescued by the police but suffered ongoing anger and hatred towards her abductor until one day she read ‘The Word 4U 2Day’.</p>
<p>She said: ‘... I had an ongoing anger and hatred towards him.  I have to say I was miserable, but I kept on reading The Word 4U 2Day which has dramatically changed my life.  I started realising how blessed I am.  When I started reading ‘Let it go’ I felt the power of the Holy Spirit dwelling in me, and felt that what he had done to me was the work of the devil and he’d  failed.   A  lot of  people  cannot understand how I can forgive somebody who has treated me badly.  But the more you forgive, the more you receive the showers of blessing, and the healing process is amazing.’</p>
<p>‘The Word for Today’ (‘The Word 4U 2Day’ is the version for teenagers) is a booklet of short thoughts for the day, published quarterly and copies are available free to pick up in All Saints, Wing and SS Peter and Paul, Wingrave (or get in touch with me), or you can view them online at <a href="http://www.ucb.co.uk/" title="www.ucb.co.uk">www.ucb.co.uk</a>   They are published by   UCB   (United Christian Broadcasters) which,   from   1st December last year, began broadcasting God’s Word nationally on digital radio.  Magdeline discovered that God and His Word are the most powerful thing in this world.<br />
So can you.</p>

    <p>The continuing story of Jack and Jill…</p>
<p>Jack was about to marry Jill and his father took him to one side, 'When I married your mother, the first thing I did when we got home was take off my trousers,' he said.  'I gave them to your mother and told her to put them on.  When she did, they were enormous on her and she said to me that she couldn't possibly wear them, as they were too large.  I told her, 'of course they're too big.   I  wear  the trousers in this family and I always will.'  Ever since that day, we have never had a single problem. 'Jack took   his   father's advice and as soon as he got Jill alone after the wedding, he did the same thing; took off his trousers, gave them to Jill and told her to put them on.  Jill  said  that  the trousers were too big and  she  couldn't possibly wear them.  'Exactly,' replied Jack. 'I wear the trousers in this relationship and I always will.  I don't want you to forget that.' Jill paused and removed her knickers and gave them to Jack.  'Try these on,' she said, so he tried them on but they were too small.  'I can't possibly get into your knickers,' said Jack. 'Exactly,' replied Jill.  'And if you don't change your attitude, you never will.'</p>
<p>Jokes are great vehicles for showing up  our  underlying attitudes.  Most of us have    a    natural tendency to be just like Jack and Jill – selfish and controlling.  It’s the part of our humanity that messes up relationships and the world we live in.  I don’t think Jack and Jill’s marriage would have gone the distance. </p>
<p>Jesus made it clear that this is not God’s   way.   His  way  is  of  unselfish, unwarranted, unstoppable, unending  love  for others.  Jesus said: ‘Love God and love your neighbour as yourself.’  He calls us to be unselfish, just like him, if we want a better world, a better atmosphere at work and home, a better relationship with those we love.  He calls us to stand up for  the  rights  of others but not our own.  He told us to love our enemies, to love the unlovable, to ‘go the extra mile’, to take care of the stranger.  It’s hard to sacrifice ourselves like this but oh so worth it!</p>
<p>A world without any selfishness would be heaven, wouldn’t it?</p>
<p>Shalom</p>

  <div class="content">
    <p>When I was but a lad I lived in London and when I was 9 my parents changed my primary school. This meant that I used to travel on my own 3 stops on the tube and 2 stops on the bus to get to school. London buses at the time were renowned for their ‘convoys’.  You wouldn’t see one for ages then 3 or 4 would turn up at once, all packed to the rafters so you couldn’t get on! </p>
<p>Over the years I’ve found that troubles are a bit like buses – you’re just enjoying a nice calm period in your life, then WHAM! A whole bunch of troubles turn up at once.  Last week it seemed that everything that was fairly new was breaking – cars, tents, roof-lights – it’s not so much the immediate disappointment that’s hard, it’s the fact that it seems to take up so much of our time to get anything fixed (just try to find the Bosch lawnmower man in the middle of Luton!).</p>
<p>The amazing thing is, though, it’s through these times of trouble that God can transform our lives.  In fact God seems to depend more on using our circumstances to make us like Jesus than he depends on us reading the bible. Life is a series of problems and God uses problems (he does NOT create them!) to draw us closer to himself.  The Psalmist wrote: “The Lord is close to the broken hearted; he rescues those who are crushed in spirit.”<br />
(Psalm 34:18). One of the most intimate times I’ve had with Him was during  a  time  of worship with students on a Christian camp the evening after I had learned that my mother died.  This only happens if we allow God into our lives.   God  is  the ultimate in good manners – he’ll never barge in, he’ll always wait to be invited.</p>
<p>Eaten on their own flour, salt, raw eggs, sugar and oil taste pretty disgusting.  Bake them mixed together and they    become    a delicious cake.  If you will give God all your troubles, all your unpleasant experiences, he will blend them together for good.    If  you  are  facing troubles ‘like buses’ right now, don’t ask, “Why me? Instead ask, “God, come close to me, comfort me, and show me what you want me to learn.”<br />
“For the troubles we see will soon be over, but the joys to come will last forever.”<br />
(1 Corinthians 4:18)</p>
<p>If you’d like to talk over any of this please get in touch.</p>
