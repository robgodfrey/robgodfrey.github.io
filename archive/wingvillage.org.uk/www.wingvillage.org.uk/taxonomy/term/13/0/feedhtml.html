 <title>Crime falls across the Vale once again </title>
 <link>http://www.wingvillage.org.uk/node/141</link>
 <description>&lt;p&gt;Crime has fallen by 4%* with significant decreases in Burglary and Theft of Vehicle. The recession didn’t adversely impact crime and disorder within Aylesbury Vale as had been anticipated.&lt;br /&gt;
Throughout 2009/2010 there were 520 recorded burglaries, that’s 53 lower than the previous year and 197 Thefts of a vehicle, 14 lower than the previous year. These key successes have been down to effective partnership work between the police, council and other agencies who work as part of the Community Safety Partnership. With projects such as the Hard Target &amp;amp; Home Service scheme which protect vulnerable residents by upgrading home security and Operation Accurist, our wintertime burglary campaign which gave out over 3500 home safety packs we’ve been able to keep the rate of burglary to one of the lowest across Thames Valley. To find out about other initiatives we’ve been delivering to keep crime low visit&lt;/p&gt;

In neighbourhood areas such as Buckingham, Wendover and Waddesdon we have seen positive reductions in serious acquisitive crime, with overall reductions in Aylesbury Town.
