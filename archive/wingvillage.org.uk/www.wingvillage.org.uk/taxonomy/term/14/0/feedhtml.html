 <title>Ladybirds Nearly New Sale Sat 18th September</title>
 <link>http://www.wingvillage.org.uk/node/151</link>
 <description>&lt;p&gt;
A massive thank you to everyone that supported our sale at the village hall, it was a massive success and we raised a record £600 for the toddler group! This money will now fund our Christmas Party on Saturday 4th of December for the children and we will also be buying some new toys for our weekly session, we are already planning a new musical area! The next nearly new sale will be in Spring 2011, watch this space!&lt;/p&gt;
