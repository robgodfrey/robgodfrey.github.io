 <title>Work at Jubilee Green Completes</title>
 <link>http://www.wingvillage.org.uk/node/155</link>
 <description>&lt;p&gt;Wing Parish Council are very pleased to announce that work has now completed on the new play area on Jubilee Green. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Please note the following:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The play area is very muddy at the moment. Please wear suitable footwear and clothing.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The upright tree sections in the toddler area will be carved by a chainsaw carver at the end of November&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The mounding and log walk need some time for grass to seed and therefore the temporary fencing will remain until spring next year&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;/sites/default/files/jg/JG-Graphic.jpg&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/sites/default/files/jg/JG-Graphic-thumb.jpg&quot;/&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Getting to this stage is the result of 2 years of effort by the Jubilee Green Management Committee and Wing Parish Council. Earlier this year the committee were successful in obtaining a grant from WREN for £50,000 towards the cost of the project. Other funding has been provided by AVDC and a Section 106 development grant, with the remainder being made up the parish council. The project has cost close to £75,000 (inc VAT). &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The new play area has been designed in accordance with guidance from Play England and in consultation with the AVDC green spaces team, and includes new equipment as well as natural mounds and ditches, and incorporating the tree trunk sections felled earlier this year. A ROSPA post installation safety inspection has been carried out, with no major issues highlighted. Some minor issues with the matting surfacing have been resolved, and the installers will be out to resolve some issues with the log walk (currently fenced off) in due course.   &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;An official opening event will take place early in the new year. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Please direct any queries / questions to &lt;a href=&quot;/parishcouncil&quot;&gt;Wing Parish Council&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;About WREN&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;WREN is a not-for-profit business that helps benefit the lives of people who live close to landfill sites by awarding grants for environmental, heritage and community projects.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Our directors, staff and the people on our regionally based advisory panels are fully committed to enhancing the social environment, natural conservation and heritage aspects of the world in which we live and create a beneficial and lasting legacy for future generations.&lt;/p&gt;
