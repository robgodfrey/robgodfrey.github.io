 <title>Tabby Cat Found</title>
 <link>http://www.wingvillage.org.uk/node/174</link>
 <description>&lt;p&gt;Do you own a male Tabby Cat of approximately 4 to 5 years old that has gone missing?  He was found in Ledburn on the 15th July.  He is very friendly and affectionate and I would like him to be reunited with his owner.          &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you think this is your cat, could you please contact Nikki on 07984 256931&lt;/p&gt;
