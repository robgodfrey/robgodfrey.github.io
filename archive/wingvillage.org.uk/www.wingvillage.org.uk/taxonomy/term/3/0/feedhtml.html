 <title>The view from the Vicarage - Feb 2011</title>
 <link>http://www.wingvillage.org.uk/node/157</link>
 <description>&lt;p&gt;Two men, deep in conversation, walked down a bustling city street. One is at home, the other visiting from the countryside.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Passing a tree, the visitor suddenly stopped.  ‘Can you hear that?’ he asked as pedestrians squeezed and bumped past them.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;‘Hear what?’ his friend replied.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;‘The cricket singing.  It must be in the tree.’  He leant with one ear towards the tree to tune into the source of the song.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;‘There’s no cricket, it’s in your head!’ the city worker exclaimed, as a woman walked by shouting into her phone.  ‘And, even if there were, you’d never hear it over the noise of all these people and this traffic.’&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The visitor’s friend laughed and walked on.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But, as he did so, the visitor pulled a small coin from his pocket and let it drop to the ground.  The coin hit the pavement and quietly rolled to rest.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Intuitively his friend twisted his head round, glancing over his shoulder at the ground to search for the coin.  At the same moment, perhaps twenty other pedestrians surreptitiously scanned the ground as they walked by.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;With a smile, the visitor looked at his friend and said, ‘You’re listening to the wrong tune.’&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When we become attuned to the music of creation, we notice God’s harmonies everywhere.  We hear them in the echoes of the mountain range and the heaving of the sea, sitting round a meal table with friends, in the shining eyes of an old man who allows a memory to touch the surface of his mind, in the quiet contentment of a babbling baby.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Those who do not listen will not hear.  Those who do not search will see nothing but the obvious:  ‘in spite of his wonders, they did not believe’  Psalm 78:32&lt;/p&gt;

 <title>The View from the Vicarage - December 2010 </title>
 <link>http://www.wingvillage.org.uk/node/156</link>
 <description>&lt;p&gt;Years ago a wealthy widower, shared a passion for art collecting with his only child, Mark. Together  they  travelled  around  the  world, adding priceless works to their collection by the likes of Picasso, Van Gogh and Monet.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As winter approached, war engulfed their nation, and Mark left to serve his country.  After only a few short weeks, his father received a telegram; his beloved son had died saving the life of a fellow soldier.  Distraught, the old man faced the approaching Christmas with anguish and sadness.&lt;br /&gt;
On Christmas morning a knock on the door woke him.  At the door was a soldier with a large package.  “I was a friend of Mark,” the soldier said.  “I was the one he rescued.  May I come in, I have something to show you?”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The old man learned that Mark had rescued dozens of soldiers before a bullet took his caring heart.  The soldier then recounted how Mark had spoken of his father’s love of fine art.  Giving the package to the old man, the soldier told him, “I’m an artist.  I want you to have this.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The old man unwrapped the package revealing a portrait of his son.  The canvas featured the young man’s face in striking detail, though the world would never consider the painting the work of a genius.  Overcome with emotion, the man thanked the soldier as he left.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The old man set about hanging the portrait above the fireplace, pushing aside paintings by masters that had cost thousands of dollars.  Seating himself in his chair, he spent Christmas gazing at the gift he had been given.  In the weeks that followed, the man grew peaceful realizing that Mark lived on because of those he had touched. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The following Spring, the old man became ill and died.  The art world stirred in anticipation of the public auction of the old man&#039;s estate.  He had stipulated that his collection be sold on Christmas Day—the day he had received his greatest gift.  On the appointed day art collectors from around the world gathered to bid.&lt;br /&gt;
The auction began with a painting not on any museum’s must-have list—the soldier&#039;s painting of the old man’s son.  “May I have an opening bid?”  The room was silent.  “Who will open the bidding with $100?”  the Auctioneer prompted.  Minutes passed and still no one spoke.  “Who cares about that painting?” shouted a bidder from the back of the room, “It’s just a picture of his son.  Forget it, go on to the good stuff.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“No, we have to sell this one first,” replied the auctioneer. “Now, who will take the son?” Finally, a friend of the old man spoke.  “I&#039;d like to have the painting.  I knew the boy.  Will you take ten dollars for it?  That’s all I have.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“I have ten dollars,&quot; called the auctioneer.  “Will anyone go higher?”  More silence.  “Going once... Going twice,&quot; he said looking around for any takers.  “Gone,” he said at last.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Now  we  can  get  on  with  bidding  on  these treasures!” said the man from the back.&lt;br /&gt;
Over the microphone the auctioneer said.  “Thank you for coming. The auction is now over.”&lt;br /&gt;
Stunned disbelief quieted the room.  “What do you mean it’s over?” growled an irate bidder, “What about  all  of  these  other  paintings?   There  are millions of dollars of art here!”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“It’s very simple,&quot; replied the auctioneer.  “According to the will of the father, whoever takes the son... gets it all.&lt;br /&gt;
(Adapted from 2001 Youth Specialities Inc)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That is the will of the Father today. Whoever takes the Son... gets it all.  When you take Jesus the Christ, the babe born in a manger in Bethlehem over 2000 years ago, as your Saviour, you will have the riches of life to its fullest (John 10:10, Matthew 6:33) – the only Christmas present worth having!       &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Debbie and I wish you all a very peaceful and blessed Christmas&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Shalom&lt;br /&gt;

 <title>Wing Church Goes Green!</title>
 <link>http://www.wingvillage.org.uk/node/153</link>
 <description>&lt;p&gt;Solar power for the Saxon Church&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Our Anglo Saxon church, recognised as being one of the finest in England, is being fitted with state-of-&lt;br /&gt;
the art solar panels.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Church of England has a Shrinking the Footprint national environmental campaign and a recent&lt;br /&gt;
BBC’s Songs of Praise programme came from St Denys Church, Sleaford, Lincolnshire and showed what&lt;br /&gt;
was possible with the technology. All churches face east and therefore have the south facing roofs ideal&lt;br /&gt;
for solar installations - but could modern equipment be installed on such an ancient monument as ours&lt;br /&gt;
with its four star rating in Simon Jenkins book England’s Thousand Best Churches?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The members of All Saints’ decided that they could not just talk about, and pray for, the environment;&lt;br /&gt;
there was a need to get out there and do something to look after God’s creation by reducing their&lt;br /&gt;
carbon footprint. After a huge effort to prove feasibility and get all the necessary permissions, grants&lt;br /&gt;
and donations for the work, installation of 54 photovoltaic panels starts in November. Wing Church is&lt;br /&gt;
the first to be so equipped in the whole of the Oxford Diocese and hopefully will set a standard for others&lt;br /&gt;
to follow.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Not only will we be doing good for the environment, but also we will gain free electricity and added&lt;br /&gt;
income from the government’s new Feed-In tariffs. These were introduced in April 2010 for the energy&lt;br /&gt;
we put into the National Grid. This is an exciting project and hopefully the first in a series to make Wing&lt;br /&gt;
Church carbon neutral.&lt;/p&gt;

 <title>The View from the Vicarage - June 2010</title>
 <link>http://www.wingvillage.org.uk/node/143</link>
 <description>&lt;p&gt;     It was our final night as we were walking towards the Big Top at Spring Harvest. I recalled friends returning from this 10 years ago saying how everyone had been given £10 and asked to use it to raise £100 and send the money back to the charity.  I had wondered how I would turn £10 into £100.  However, this night, I thought if that happened now I would use it to kick-start the café and send the first £100 to the charity.  When we arrived at the meeting, everyone was handed an envelope with the instruction not to open it until told to do so.  The thought popped into my head ‘there’s going to be £10 in there’, but I just put the envelope in my bag and forgot about it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;     Mid-way through the evening we were shown a DVD by Hope HIV, a charity which works with children in Africa orphaned and affected by AIDS.  The founder of Hope HIV came on the stage and told  us  to  open  our envelopes.  Inside was £10.  This money had been borrowed and we reckon there may have been over 4000 people there that night!  We were given 3 choices: 1) return the money, possibly with a little extra added 2) if our need was greater than the children in the DVD we could keep the money with their blessing 3) use the money to raise £100 and send it to Hope HIV.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;     For some time Derek and I have thought it would be a good idea to provide a café for Wing.  During March I asked mums attending Church Mice and Pop In &amp;amp; Paint to fill in a simple questionnaire, where a café proved to be the most popular idea.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;     I turned to Derek and said the money was to kick-start the café, so Derek added his £10 to mine and said we’ll send the first £200 to Hope HIV.  When they did this 10 years ago at Spring Harvest they raised £2,000,000&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;     Thanks to the generosity of members of our congregation and friends at Wing Chapel, contributing towards the cost of a coffee maker and refreshments, by the time you are reading this, Café Oasis will have opened in All Saints Church on a Saturday morning.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;     Café Oasis—a place of refreshing for all the family— provides&lt;br /&gt;
Fairtrade tea/coffee or squash and homemade cake for £1 per person.  Come along and try us out between 10am and 12 noon on Saturdays 19 &amp;amp; 26 June, 3 July or Fridays 9 &amp;amp; 16 July.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;     We have newspapers as well as toys for young  children  and  a colouring     table available,   aiming   to provide   a    relaxed meeting place for  all  ages.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;     Come along and help us raise £200 for the children in Africa!&lt;/p&gt;

 <title>The View from the Vicarage - May 2010</title>

 <description>&lt;p&gt;Another:  &lt;i&gt;On the 1st day, God created the dog and said:&lt;br /&gt;
   ‘Sit all day by the door of your house and bark at anyone who comes in or walks past.  For this, I will give you a life span of 20 years.&#039;&lt;br /&gt;
   The dog said: &#039;That&#039;s a long time to be barking.  How about only 10 years and I&#039;ll give you back the other 10?&#039;&lt;br /&gt;
So God agreed.&lt;br /&gt;
   On the 2nd day, God created the monkey and said:&lt;br /&gt;
   &#039;Entertain people, do tricks, and make them laugh.  For this, I&#039;ll give you a 20 year life span.&#039;&lt;br /&gt;
   The monkey said: &#039;Monkey tricks for 20 years?  That&#039;s a pretty long time to perform.  How about I give you back 10 like the dog did?&#039;&lt;br /&gt;
And God agreed.&lt;br /&gt;
   On the 3rd day, God created the cow and said:&lt;br /&gt;
   ‘You must go into the field with the farmer all day long and suffer under the sun, have calves and give milk to support the farmer&#039;s family.  For this, I will give you a life span of 60 years.&#039;&lt;br /&gt;
   The cow said: &#039;That&#039;s kind of a tough life you want me to live for 60 years.  How about 20 and I&#039;ll give back the other forty?&#039;&lt;br /&gt;
And God agreed again.&lt;br /&gt;
   On the 4th day, God created humans and said:&lt;br /&gt;
   &#039;Eat, sleep, play, marry and enjoy your life.  For this, I&#039;ll give you 20 years.&#039;&lt;br /&gt;
   But the human said: ‘Only 20 years?  Could you possibly give me my 20, the 40 the cow gave back, the 10 the monkey gave back, and the 10 the dog gave back; that makes 80, okay?&#039;&lt;br /&gt;
   ‘Okay,&#039; said God, &#039;You asked for it.&#039;&lt;br /&gt;
   So that is why for our first 20 years we eat, sleep, play and enjoy ourselves.  For the next 40 years we slave in the sun to support our family.  For the next 10 years we do monkey tricks to entertain the grandchildren and for the last 10 years we sit on the front porch and bark at everyone.&lt;br /&gt;
   Life   has   now   been explained to you.&lt;br /&gt;
Funny… but it also raises a serious point – because if that’s all life can offer then God’s messing with us!&lt;br /&gt;
But it’s not…&lt;/i&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
God sent His Son Jesus into His creation to show us how we can live a life that is rich, satisfying, a blessing to others, full of hope and love and where death is not an end but a doorway to a new life.  He offers a new life so good we’d be completely crazy to miss out on it!&lt;br /&gt;
So why do so many of us fail to accept the gift?  Are we suspicious that something so good must be too good to be true?&lt;br /&gt;
God promises He will only give to His creation good things.  God promises a taste of life in its fullness now and He promises the whole renewed world to be our playground, our ‘heaven’, when we die.&lt;br /&gt;
He promises all this to those who follow the Way shown to us by Jesus.&lt;br /&gt;
Do you know the Way? &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Shalom&lt;br /&gt;

 <title>The View from the Vicarage - April 2010</title>
 <link>http://www.wingvillage.org.uk/node/133</link>
 <description>&lt;p&gt;A touch of Easter shopping?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As I was walking down life&#039;s highway&lt;br /&gt;
many years ago&lt;br /&gt;
I came upon a sign that read&lt;br /&gt;
Heavens Grocery Store.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When I got a little closer&lt;br /&gt;
The doors swung open wide&lt;br /&gt;
And when I came to myself&lt;br /&gt;
I was standing inside.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I saw a host of Angels.&lt;br /&gt;
They were standing everywhere&lt;br /&gt;
One handed me a basket&lt;br /&gt;
And said &#039;My child shop with care.&#039;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Everything a human needed&lt;br /&gt;
Was in that grocery store&lt;br /&gt;
And what you could not carry&lt;br /&gt;
You could come back for more&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;First I got some patience.&lt;br /&gt;
Love was in that same row.&lt;br /&gt;
Further down was understanding,&lt;br /&gt;
You need that everywhere you go.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I got a box or two of Wisdom&lt;br /&gt;
And Faith a bag or two.&lt;br /&gt;
And Charity of course&lt;br /&gt;
I would need some of that too.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I couldn&#039;t miss the Holy Ghost&lt;br /&gt;
It was all over the place.&lt;br /&gt;
And then some strength and Courage&lt;br /&gt;
to help me run this race.&lt;br /&gt;
My basket was getting full&lt;br /&gt;
But I remembered I needed Grace.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And then I chose Salvation for&lt;br /&gt;
Salvation was for free&lt;br /&gt;
I tried to get enough of that&lt;br /&gt;
to do for you and me.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Then I started to the counter&lt;br /&gt;
To pay my grocery bill.&lt;br /&gt;
For I thought I had everything&lt;br /&gt;
To do the Masters will.&lt;br /&gt;
As I went up the aisle I saw&lt;br /&gt;
Prayer and put that in,&lt;br /&gt;
For I knew when I stepped outside&lt;br /&gt;
I would run into Sin.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Peace and Joy were plentiful,&lt;br /&gt;
The last things on the shelf.&lt;br /&gt;
Song and Praise were hanging near&lt;br /&gt;
So I just helped myself. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Then I said to the angel&lt;br /&gt;
&#039;Now how much do I owe?&#039;&lt;br /&gt;
He smiled and said:&lt;br /&gt;
&#039;Just take them everywhere you go.&#039;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Again I asked: &#039;Really now,&lt;br /&gt;
How much do I owe?&#039;&lt;br /&gt;
&#039;My child&#039; he said, &#039;God paid your bill&lt;br /&gt;
A long long time ago.&#039;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At Easter we remember that Jesus died on a cross to pay our ‘bill’ for going our own way and not God’s. He did this so that if and when we turn back to God, there is no barrier of an unpaid debt and we are accepted just as we are, warts and all!&lt;br /&gt;
But the good news doesn’t stop there!&lt;br /&gt;
God raised Jesus from the dead and made sure there were many witnesses. But that’s still not the really good news.&lt;br /&gt;
The really good news is that God promises that anyone who follows the way of Jesus will follow Jesus through the door of death to a fresh new life just like he did - a life where we can play for eternity in the playground of a renewed earth and a universe suddenly full of life.&lt;br /&gt;
I can’t wait – and the good news is I don’t have to. If I follow the way of Jesus now I can enjoy a taste of heaven on earth, I can be to others a taste of heaven on earth, because Jesus will be walking with me!&lt;br /&gt;
Shalom&lt;/p&gt;

 <title>The View from the Vicarage - Jan 2010</title>
 <link>http://www.wingvillage.org.uk/node/129</link>
 <description>&lt;p&gt;About a year ago, you may remember Magdeline Makola, a nurse in Scotland,  was locked in the boot of her own car  for  10  days without   food   or water and deprived of her basic needs.  Her captor had threatened to kill her if she didn’t give him the PIN number to her bank account.  Magdeline miraculously survived this harrowing ordeal and was rescued by the police but suffered ongoing anger and hatred towards her abductor until one day she read ‘The Word 4U 2Day’.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;She said: ‘... I had an ongoing anger and hatred towards him.  I have to say I was miserable, but I kept on reading The Word 4U 2Day which has dramatically changed my life.  I started realising how blessed I am.  When I started reading ‘Let it go’ I felt the power of the Holy Spirit dwelling in me, and felt that what he had done to me was the work of the devil and he’d  failed.   A  lot of  people  cannot understand how I can forgive somebody who has treated me badly.  But the more you forgive, the more you receive the showers of blessing, and the healing process is amazing.’&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;‘The Word for Today’ (‘The Word 4U 2Day’ is the version for teenagers) is a booklet of short thoughts for the day, published quarterly and copies are available free to pick up in All Saints, Wing and SS Peter and Paul, Wingrave (or get in touch with me), or you can view them online at &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.ucb.co.uk&quot; title=&quot;www.ucb.co.uk&quot;&gt;www.ucb.co.uk&lt;/a&gt;   They are published by   UCB   (United Christian Broadcasters) which,   from   1st December last year, began broadcasting God’s Word nationally on digital radio.  Magdeline discovered that God and His Word are the most powerful thing in this world.&lt;br /&gt;
So can you.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Shalom&lt;/p&gt;

 <title>The View from the Vicarge - November 2009</title>
 <link>http://www.wingvillage.org.uk/node/124</link>
 <description>&lt;p&gt;The continuing story of Jack and Jill…&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Jack was about to marry Jill and his father took him to one side, &#039;When I married your mother, the first thing I did when we got home was take off my trousers,&#039; he said.  &#039;I gave them to your mother and told her to put them on.  When she did, they were enormous on her and she said to me that she couldn&#039;t possibly wear them, as they were too large.  I told her, &#039;of course they&#039;re too big.   I  wear  the trousers in this family and I always will.&#039;  Ever since that day, we have never had a single problem. &#039;Jack took   his   father&#039;s advice and as soon as he got Jill alone after the wedding, he did the same thing; took off his trousers, gave them to Jill and told her to put them on.  Jill  said  that  the trousers were too big and  she  couldn&#039;t possibly wear them.  &#039;Exactly,&#039; replied Jack. &#039;I wear the trousers in this relationship and I always will.  I don&#039;t want you to forget that.&#039; Jill paused and removed her knickers and gave them to Jack.  &#039;Try these on,&#039; she said, so he tried them on but they were too small.  &#039;I can&#039;t possibly get into your knickers,&#039; said Jack. &#039;Exactly,&#039; replied Jill.  &#039;And if you don&#039;t change your attitude, you never will.&#039;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Jokes are great vehicles for showing up  our  underlying attitudes.  Most of us have    a    natural tendency to be just like Jack and Jill – selfish and controlling.  It’s the part of our humanity that messes up relationships and the world we live in.  I don’t think Jack and Jill’s marriage would have gone the distance. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Jesus made it clear that this is not God’s   way.   His  way  is  of  unselfish, unwarranted, unstoppable, unending  love  for others.  Jesus said: ‘Love God and love your neighbour as yourself.’  He calls us to be unselfish, just like him, if we want a better world, a better atmosphere at work and home, a better relationship with those we love.  He calls us to stand up for  the  rights  of others but not our own.  He told us to love our enemies, to love the unlovable, to ‘go the extra mile’, to take care of the stranger.  It’s hard to sacrifice ourselves like this but oh so worth it!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A world without any selfishness would be heaven, wouldn’t it?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Shalom&lt;/p&gt;

 <title>The View from the Vicarage - October 2009</title>
 <link>http://www.wingvillage.org.uk/node/123</link>
 <description>&lt;p&gt;When I was but a lad I lived in London and when I was 9 my parents changed my primary school. This meant that I used to travel on my own 3 stops on the tube and 2 stops on the bus to get to school. London buses at the time were renowned for their ‘convoys’.  You wouldn’t see one for ages then 3 or 4 would turn up at once, all packed to the rafters so you couldn’t get on! &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Over the years I’ve found that troubles are a bit like buses – you’re just enjoying a nice calm period in your life, then WHAM! A whole bunch of troubles turn up at once.  Last week it seemed that everything that was fairly new was breaking – cars, tents, roof-lights – it’s not so much the immediate disappointment that’s hard, it’s the fact that it seems to take up so much of our time to get anything fixed (just try to find the Bosch lawnmower man in the middle of Luton!).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The amazing thing is, though, it’s through these times of trouble that God can transform our lives.  In fact God seems to depend more on using our circumstances to make us like Jesus than he depends on us reading the bible. Life is a series of problems and God uses problems (he does NOT create them!) to draw us closer to himself.  The Psalmist wrote: “The Lord is close to the broken hearted; he rescues those who are crushed in spirit.”&lt;br /&gt;
(Psalm 34:18). One of the most intimate times I’ve had with Him was during  a  time  of worship with students on a Christian camp the evening after I had learned that my mother died.  This only happens if we allow God into our lives.   God  is  the ultimate in good manners – he’ll never barge in, he’ll always wait to be invited.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Eaten on their own flour, salt, raw eggs, sugar and oil taste pretty disgusting.  Bake them mixed together and they    become    a delicious cake.  If you will give God all your troubles, all your unpleasant experiences, he will blend them together for good.    If  you  are  facing troubles ‘like buses’ right now, don’t ask, “Why me? Instead ask, “God, come close to me, comfort me, and show me what you want me to learn.”&lt;br /&gt;
“For the troubles we see will soon be over, but the joys to come will last forever.”&lt;br /&gt;
(1 Corinthians 4:18)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you’d like to talk over any of this please get in touch.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Shalom&lt;/p&gt;

 <title>The View from the Vicarge - September 2009</title>
 <link>http://www.wingvillage.org.uk/node/120</link>
 <description>&lt;p&gt;I recently received this curious e-mail:&lt;br /&gt;
     “I decide to water my garden.  As I turn on the hose in the driveway, I look over at my car and decide it needs washing. As I start towards the garage, I notice today&#039;s post on the porch table that I left there earlier. I decide to go through the post before I wash the car. I lay my car keys on the table, put the junk mail in the rubbish bin under the table, and notice that it is full.  So, I decide to put the bills back on the table and take out the rubbish first, but then I think, since I&#039;m going to be near the letterbox when I take out the rubbish anyway, I may as well pay the bills first. I take my cheque book off the table, and see that there is only one cheque left. My extra cheques are in my desk in the study, so I go inside the house to my desk where I find the tin of beer I&#039;d been drinking. I&#039;m going to look for my cheques, but first I need to push the beer aside so that I don&#039;t accidentally knock it over. The beer is getting warm, and I decide to put it in the fridge to keep it cold. As I head toward the kitchen with the beer, a vase of flowers on the counter catches my eye - they need water. I put the beer on the counter and discover my reading glasses that I&#039;ve been searching for all morning. I decide I better put them back on my desk, but first I&#039;m going to water the flowers. I set the glasses back down on the counter, fill a container with water and suddenly spot the TV remote. Someone left it on the kitchen table. I realize that tonight when we go to watch TV, I&#039;ll be looking for the remote, but I won&#039;t remember that it&#039;s on the kitchen table, so I decide to put it back in the lounge where it belongs, but first I&#039;ll water the flowers. I pour some water in the flowers, but quite a bit of it spills on the floor. So, I set the remote back on the table, get some towels and wipe up the spill. Then, I head down the hall trying to remember what I was planning to do.&lt;br /&gt;
At the end of the day:&lt;br /&gt;
     the car isn&#039;t washed&lt;br /&gt;
     the bills aren&#039;t paid&lt;br /&gt;
     there is a warm tin of beer sitting on the counter&lt;br /&gt;
     the flowers don&#039;t have enough water&lt;br /&gt;
     there is still only 1 cheque in my cheque book&lt;br /&gt;
     I can&#039;t find the remote&lt;br /&gt;
     I can&#039;t find my glasses&lt;br /&gt;
     and I don&#039;t remember what I did with the car keys&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Then, when I try to work out why nothing got done today, I&#039;m really baffled because I know I was busy all day, and I&#039;m really tired. I realise this is a serious problem, and I&#039;ll try to get some help for it, but first I&#039;ll check my e-mail...&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Do me a favour. Forward this message to everyone you know, because I don&#039;t remember who the heck I&#039;ve sent it to.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Don&#039;t laugh -- if this isn&#039;t you yet, your day is coming!!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We lead such busy lives. We charge around like bluebottles trying to get things done. It was just the same in Jesus’ day but he had the solution. He followed his Father’s plan and always made sure he had a day off each week, always made sure he took ‘time-out’ during the day, and made sure his pace of life was slower. Companies that follow Christian principles and ensure staff never have to stay late and take a good lunch-break find that more work gets done more efficiently by a happier workforce. We shouldn’t be surprised – it’s simply following the way of the one who created us. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Following God’s way in all things makes for a life where we can be fully human.&lt;br /&gt;
Shalom&lt;/p&gt;
