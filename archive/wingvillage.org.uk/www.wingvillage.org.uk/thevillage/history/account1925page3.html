    <h2>Church</h2>
<p>The church of ALL SAINTS consists of a chancel 21 ft. by 21 ft., with a crypt beneath, nave 61 ft. by 21 ft., north aisle 12 ft. wide, south aisle 13 ft. 6 in. wide, west tower 16 ft. square, and north and south porches. The measurements are internal.</p>
<p>Although the date of the building is not authenticated, it is probably of the 10th century. The plan was then practically the same as at present, without the west tower and the north and south porches. The building probably remained in its original state until the 13th century, when an arch was inserted in the length of walling to the east of each arcade of the nave. The walls of the south aisle were rebuilt and windows inserted in the north aisle in the next century. In the 15th century the tower was built and the clearstory was added to the nave ; the porches were built, more windows were inserted, and the greater part of the church was re-roofed. The church was repaired at various times in the 17th and 18th centuries, the entries of payments made for this purpose being preserved in the Churchwardens' Accounts. In 1881 the crypt was cleared of rubbish and repaired, while in 1893 the whole building was thoroughly restored.</p>
<p>The walling generally is of small rubble masonry with wide jointing, the lower parts of the walls having a semblance of coursing. The upper part of the wall of the south aisle is of large stones, while the tower is built of large ashlar blocks. The parapets are all cemented, and at intervals beneath them are some very interesting gargoyles and grotesque heads, including a miser with his money bags and a monkey playing the bagpipes. The clearstory walls bear a number of dates in ironwork, probably referring to various repairs executed at these times.</p>
<p>The roofs are covered with lead.</p>
<p>The crypt, like the chancel above it, is apsidal and forms an irregular figure of seven sides. It is rudely constructed of rough rubble masonry, and consists of a central chamber having the plan of an irregular octagon and an outer ambulatory with which it communicates by three round arches. The outer wall opposite to these arches is pierced by three low windows ; that on the south now serves as the entrance to the crypt. The ambulatory has a barrel vault and the central chamber a vault of domical character built of long narrow stones roughly set with wide joints. Access to the crypt was obtained by two stairways leading from the north and south aisles, and, although these have now disappeared the arches into the crypt still remain.</p>
<p>On the outer faces of the chancel apse is a lofty and shallow arcade of seven round arches, each arch spanning the full width of a face and Springing from narrow pilasters at the angles. At a higher level there are remains of a wall arcade of triangular arches preserving on two of the faces small original round-headed lights now blocked. Previous to the last restoration these external features were hidden by the rough-cast with which the walls were covered. Three windows were inserted in the 15th century directly over the openings to the crypt, that on the east face being of three transomed lights with tracery in a four-centred head,. and the others of three cinquefoiled lights in segmental heads. These last replace original narrow windows with round heads, traces of which still remain. It is probable that there was also a similar light in the east face, but all traces of it have been obliterated.</p>
<p>At the west end of the south wall, blocked by a tomb, is a low-side lancet window of the 13th century, chamfered and rebated externally. This window was discovered on the removal of the roughcast from the exterior in 1893. Internally the chancel walls are coated with plaster and the roof has a flat boarded ceiling. The 15th-century pillar piscina stands on a shaft with a moulded base and has a pointed chamfered recess. The high, wide semi-circular chancel arch is of a single plain square order projecting slightly beyond the wall surface on the nave side</p>
<p>In the east wall of the nave above the chancel arch is an original window which was discovered at the 1893 restoration. It consists of two round-headed openings with arches of Roman bricks springing from square jambs, and supported in the centre by a round shaft, with a square capital. The north and south arcades are each of four bays. The eastern arch in each arcade is an insertion of 13th-century date, two-centred and of two chamfered orders, with a label on the nave side, and springs from jambs of the same section with moulded abaci, except on the east side of the northern arch, where the inner order springs from a moulded corbel. The remaining arches are original work ; they are semicircular, of a single plain square order, and spring from square jambs with corbelled imposts. Above the arches the walls diminish in thickness, and show the springing level of the original roof and the 15th-century heightening of the walls. The clearstory has four tall windows on each side the eastern three in each wall are each of two cinquefoiled four-centred lights with tracery in a square head the western window is of two cinquefoiled lights with tracery in a segmental head ; all have external labels. At the east end of the south wall is the upper r 5th-century doorway to the rood-loft stair. On the east pier of the second arch from the east in the same wall is a 14th-century moulded corbel enriched with four-leaved ornament and carved with a leopard's head.</p>
<p>The north aisle has a 15th-century east window, recessed externally, of three cinquefoiled lights in a four-centred head with an external label. Below the east window is an original doorway, now blocked, which apparently opened to the stairway to the crypt. The north wall contains three windows, the eastern of which is similar to the east window of the aisle, but is hidden internally by the monument erected in 1552 above the Dormer vault. The second window is of 14th-century date and of three cinquefoiled lights with tracery in a two-centred head, containing in the tracery some fragments of contemporary glass, including two shields of Warenne, one of which has the difference of a label. The third window, also of the 14th century, is of two cinquefoiled lights with a quatrefoil in a two-centred head, and has a moulded rear arch and inner and outer labels, the latter having one old head-stop. Between the last two windows is a doorway of 15th-century date, with a two-centred head and jambs continuously moulded and an external label with stops carved with demi-angels. It retains its original lock. The west window is of 15th-century date and of two cinquefoiled four-centred lights with tracery in a segmental head. At the east end of the south wall is a piscina, apparently of the 15th century, with a pointed trefoiled head.</p>
<p>The south aisle has an early 14th-century east window of three cinquefoiled lights with tracery in a two-centred head. In the central light of the tracery are some fragments of old glass, including a shield Warenne hanging from a tree, between the seated figures of a king and queen. It has been suggested that these figures were all close together, and represented our Lord seated, His right arm raised to crown the Blessed Virgin kneeling by His side. There is a 15th-century moulded corbel on each side of the window carved as a head. At the east end of the north wall is the lower doorway with the stair to the former rood-loft. On the south side of the second pier of the nave arcade is a small shallow niche of 15th-century date with a moulded sill and a projecting canopy. The south wall contains three windows similar to the west window in the north wall of the north aisle, all having moulded rear arches and internal labels with mask stops. Between the first and second windows is the stair to a former rood-loft, the eastern bay of this aisle having been used as a chapel from an early date. The lower doorway has a four-centred head and contains an original door, while the upper doorway has a square head. Between the second and third windows is a 14th-century doorway with a pointed head and jambs of two moulded orders, and an external label returning on either side as a string-course. It contains an old heavily studded door with the original ironwork and lock. East of the doorway internally is a rectangular recess or locker, and at the east end of the wall a piscina with a pointed head and a shelf at the back. The west window is similar to the corresponding window in the north aisle.</p>
<p>The west tower has a tall lower stage and two upper stages ; the plinth and cornice are moulded; it has an embattled parapet and square buttresses on the north, west, and south faces rising to the top of the middle stage. The lofty tower arch is two-centred and of two moulded orders, with a label on the nave side and jambs with engaged shafts and moulded capitals and bases. The west doorway is of two continuous orders, the inner pointed and the other square, with sunk spandrels and an external label. Above it is a large window of four cinquefoiled lights with tracery in a two-centred head with an external label. Low down on either side of the window is a small niche with a cinquefoiled arch in a square head, and a small length of moulded string-course above. The second stage has a small light in the east side and a pointed window of two cinquefoiled lights with tracery in the west. In the topmost stage is a window of three cinquefoiled lights with tracery in a pointed head in each face. That on the east side is now filled by the clock dial, and both this window and that on the north side bear traces of having been at some time subjected to fire.</p>
<p>The north porch, which is now used as a clergy vestry, was rebuilt and enlarged in 1893. The entrance doorway is of early 15th-century date, but much restored, and has a two-centred head and jambs enriched with quatrefoils and an external label with head-stops.</p>
<p>The south porch has angle buttresses at the south angles and intermediate buttresses at the east and west walls ; it has a moulded cornice and a modern plain coping, and is gabled on the south side ; the pinnacles and cross are modern. The entrance arch has a two-centred inner order and a square outer order, and springs from jambs having small shafts with moulded capitals 2nd bases. The spandrels are carved with foliage, and each contains an angel with a shield that in the west is rather weathered, but seems to be charged with Sackville impaling Rokes ; the eastern shield is carved with the lion of Mowbray. Above the doorway is a niche with a trefoiled head flanked by buttresses and surmounted by a moulded coping with crocketed pinnacles. The cornice is hollow moulded, and on the south side where it follows the rake of the gable it is carved with the figures of a stag and a lion. The east and west walls have each two windows of two trefoijed lights with a quatrefoil in a two-centred head and an external label.</p>
<p>The roof of the nave is of 15th-century date and of six bays, enriched with elaborate carvings. The cambered tie-beams are moulded and embattled and the spandrels above contain the figures of angels with outstretched wings holding shields. The principal rafters, purlins and ridge are all moulded and have carved bosses at the intersections. The tie-beams and principal rafters are supported at each end by a carved figure, those to the tie-beams being seated and the others standing. Between the figures is a moulded and embattled wall-plate in each bay is an angel with outstretched wings holding a shield. The roofs of the north and south aisles and north and south porches are all of 15th-century date with moulded main timbers, those of the north porch being now carried on large modern timbers.</p>
<p>In the north aisle is a brass of late 15th-century date, with two small figures of a civilian and lady, and the indents of an inscription and probably four sons and two daughters; in the top of the slab are cut the initials 'KS' and the date 1693. In this aisle is also preserved a slab, in which are indents of brasses, containing a small lozenge of later date with an inscription to Margaret Fines (Fiennes), 'whose monument is set up on ye Pillow near this place,' and describing the various places of interment in the church of her daughters, Sarah and Henrietta, and of her son Charles. The eastern bay of the south aisle, which forms St. Catherine's chapel, contains a brass with figures of a civilian and lady, an indent of children, and an inscription to Harry Blacknall (d. 1460) and Agnes his wife (d. 1489). The slab of this brass also bears a much defaced inscription recording that Elizabeth wife of Henry Redman, who died in 1733, is buried here. The chapel contains another small brass with an inscription to John Theed (d. 1622). On the south wall of the south aisle is a brass to Thomas Cotes (d. 1648), sometime porter of Ascott Hall, with a small figure. On the floor towards the west are the indents of a small figure, an inscription, and two shields.</p>
<p>The north aisle contains floor slabs to Henry Redman, steward to the Earl of Carnarvon (d. 1672) and Joyce his widow (d. 1708) ; to George Redman, son of Henry Redman (d.1699); to Henry son of Henry and Elizabeth Redman (d. 1722) ; to Stephen Russell (d. 1716) to Dorothy his youngest daughter (d.1710); to John Worley (d.1719); and to Elizabeth Worley his wife (d. 1712). In the south aisle is a floor slab to Henry son of Henry and Joyce Red man (d. 1729). Two other slabs bearing the dates 1710 and 1707 respectively are now indecipherable. A fourth appears to commemorate Edward Bromson. St. Catherine's chapel contains a floor slab to Mrs. Bridget Neale and a wall tablet to the same lady. She was the widow of John Neale and only daughter of John Meredith alias More, and died in 1677. The north aisle contains wall tablets to Sarah daughter of Norreys Fynes (Fiennes) (d. 1636); to Mrs. Henrietta Fynes (d. 1703) ; and to Mrs. Margaret Fynes, her mother (d. 1707). In the nave are monuments to Henry Fynes (d. 1758), and to Lady Anna Sophia Dormer, youngest daughter of Charles Earl of Carnarvon (d. Feb. 1694-5); and tablets to William Theed (d. 1757); to Mrs. Jane Bell (d.1721) and to Henry Bell her husband (d. 1738), and William their son (d. 1723); while in the south aisle there is a tablet to John Perkins (d. 1777).</p>
<p>The chancel contains two elaborate monuments to members of the Dormer family. That on the north side has recumbent alabaster effigies with crests at the feet of Sir William Dormer, and, on a lower level, of Dame Dorothy (Catesby), his widow, beneath a canopy with a panelled soffit surmounted by cresting and supported by Corinthian columns. The knight is in armour and the lady wears a ruff and widow's cap. On the front are the kneeling figures of their son Robert and their three daughters, Katherine, Mary, and Margaret, and cradles containing their three children who died in infancy. In the two semicircular arched recesses at the back are inscriptions recording that Sir William Dormer married first Mary daughter of Sir William Sidney, and secondly Dorothy daughter of Anthony Catesby, and died in 1575. Dorothy his widow, who erected the monument in 1590, afterwards married Sir William Pelham, and died in 1613. On the cresting above the canopy there is the crested helm and shield of Dormer flanked on either side by two shields. On the west are the arms of Dormer impaling Sidney, and of Feria (the Count of Feria married Sir William Dormer's daughter Jane) impaling the quartered coat of Dormer, surmounted by a Spanish coronet. On the east the shields show the arms of Hungerford (Sir Walter Hungerford married Sir William Dormer's daughter Anne) impaling Dormer and of Dormer impaling Catesby. On the front of the tomb are the coats of Dormer impaling Browne, for Robert (afterwards Sir Robert) Dormer, of St. John impaling Dormer, for John Lord St. John of Bletsoe, who married Katherine Dormer, and of Browne impaling Dormer, for Anthony Browne, who married Mary Dormer. At the back there is a lozenge with the arms of Catesby. The monument on the south side consists of a semicircular arched recess with a panelled soffit in which are figures of Sir Robert Dormer and Dame Elizabeth (Browne) his wife kneeling at prayer desks. The recess is flanked by Corinthian columns supporting an entablature, and on the base are the kneeling figures of three sons and two daughters, with five shields of the Dormers and their alliances below. The inscription at the back of the recess records that Sir Robert Dormer married Elizabeth daughter of Viscount Montagu, and had issue by her, six sons and three daughters.</p>
<p>At the east end of the north aisle above the family vault of the Dormers a large Palladian altar tomb stands under a canopy supported on Corinthian columns and pilasters. The whole is elaborately carved with cartouches and other enrichments and bears the date 1552. The following members of the family are buried here: Sir Robert Dormer, Sir William, and the second Sir Robert (whose monuments are in the chancel), Robert grandson and heir of the latter (who was created Earl of Carnarvon and was killed in the first battle of Newbury, 1643) and Lady Anne Herbert his wife. At the back are the arms of Dormer impaling Browne, of Dormer with its quarterings impaling Newdigate (for the first Sir Robert Dormer and Jane Newdigate his wife) of Sir William Dormer impaling Sidney, of the same impaling Catesby, and in the middle the quarterly coat of Dormer with mantled helm and crest. On the canopy is a pair of gauntlets ; above it is a funeral helm crested with a hawk standing on a glove, below which is a painted shield of Dormer.</p>
<p>The octagonal pulpit, which retains its original door, is of early 17th-century date. It is panelled in two heights and with the exception of one side which is plain the lower panels are enriched with a carved arcade and the upper panels with scrolls and crosses. It contains the original seat with turned legs.</p>
<p>The chancel screen is of r6th-century date, and consists of a wide central bay with two narrower bays on either side. It has been considerably restored and is apparently entirely modern above the springing line of the arches. The lower part has closed traceried panels and moulded mullions with buttresses from which rise semi-octagonal shafts with moulded capitals.</p>
<p>St. Catherine's chapel is divided from the nave and from the remainder of the south aisle by two screens of the same period as the chancel screen. That to the nave has an opening with a four-centred head having foliated cinquefoiled cusping ; on the east of the opening are five, and on the west two bays with traceried upper panels and closed lower panels, some of which have been removed. The top rail is original, but has modern cresting. The screen to the south aisle is similar, with four bays on each side of a central opening.</p>
<p>In the chancel are two 15th-century moulded bench ends and one standard carved with grotesque figures, and the seating of the nave contains a considerable amount of 15th-century woodwork, including moulded and embattled bench ends. There is a 17th-century table in the north porch.</p>
<p>In the north-east corner of the south porch, partly built into the wall, is the lower part of a late 12th or early 13th-century font similar in form to that of St. Mary's Church, Aylesbury. The present font is of the 15th century, and has an octagonal bowl with sunk panels, having shields carved with symbols of the Passion. The pedestal is octagonal, with cinquefoil-headed sunk panels, and has four corbels carved with figures of angels supporting the bowl.</p>
<p>Beneath the canopy of the monument in the north aisle there are two chests, one of which is mediaeval and retains its original ironwork, while the other is dated 1761.</p>
<p>There are a number of fragments of masonry in the church, including some 12th-century carved stones, some 14th or 15th-century crocketed finials, and part of a 15th-century carved and moulded basin.</p>
<p>There is a ring of six bells the treble, dated 1654, is by Ellis, Francis and Henry Knight, and is inscribed 'For the honour of Carnavan here I singe, wishing health to the neighbours of Winge; the second, 1640, inscribed 'Hope in God,' the third, 1638, inscribed ' Prayes God,' and the fourth, also 1638, are by Ellis Knight ; the fifth is by Taylor of Loughborough, 1842, and the tenor byJohn Warner &amp; Sons, 1863. There is also a sanctus, which is blank.</p>
<p>The communion plate includes a cup and cover paten of 1569 a large paten of a rare William Ill pattern, bearing the date-mark of 1699, and having an inscription stating that it was given in 1732 by Mrs. Ann Browne, widow of the Rev. William Browne, minister of this place a large silver gilt cup and cover paten of 1614, which, with the elaborate silver-gilt flagon of 1676, was the gift of Sir William Stanhope and bear his arms, and a large pewter flagon and two alms dishes probably of 18th-century date.</p>
<p>The registers before 1812 are as follows (i) baptisms and marriages from 1546 to 1749, burials from 1546 to 1684 ; (ii) burials in woollen from 1678 to 1783; (iii) baptisms from 1749 to 1783, marriages from 1749 to 1755 ; (iv) burials from 1783 to 1812 ; (v) baptisms from 1783 to 1812; (vi) marriages from 1755 to 1783 ; (vii) marriages from 1783 to 1812.</p>
<p>There is also a very interesting and complete folio volume of Churchwardens' Accounts, handsomely bound in leather in 1659 ; it consists of 235 sheets, mostly written on both sides, and covers with few gaps the period from 1527 to 1723.</p>
<p>In the churchyard stands the base and shaft of a small cross of uncertain date, now used as the pedestal for a sundial.</p>
